This system is an AI powered web application that performs predictive analysis using a Multilayer Perceptron (ML) neural network. 
The model is trained on the diabetes dataset and deployed through a Flask web interface that allows users to input feature values and receive real time predictions 
The System consists of two major components:
- Machine Learning Model (MLP)
Web Application Interface (Flask)

The deployed system follows this structure 

User Browser 
      |
Flask Web App (app.py)
      |
MLP Model Engine (mlp_model.py)
      |
Prediction Output

The web interface collects user input and sends it to the trained MLP model, which returns a predicted value.

File Descriptions 
app.py
- controls the web server
- receives form inputs
- calls the prediction function 
- displays results in browser 

mlp_model.py
- loads dataset
- scales features 
- trains mlp model
- provides predoct() function used by web app

index.html
- user interface form 
- contains 10 feature input fields 
- displays prediction result 

requirements.txt 
lists required packages for installation and deployment 

Installation Instructions (Local Run)
-install python 3.10 or newer 
- install dependencies 
    pip install flask numy scikit-learn gunicorn
- run the application
    python app.py
- open browser 
    https://127.0.0.1:5000 (the address it gives you after you run)

How to use the Web Application 
- Open the web page 
- enter numeric values in all 10 feature fields 
- click predict 
- the predicted value will be displayed
